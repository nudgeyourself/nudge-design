# Tokens

Nudge's design system to help us design with continuity and build with efficiency.

### Component
Design decisions used across multiple components. When developign and looking for applicable tokens always start here. 

### Semantic
Design decisions attached to a particular meaning or use case.

### Core
Raw values that are used by the system. Not all core tokens may be in use. These tokens represent all potential values that are compliant with the system. Avoid referencing core tokens directly whenever possible.
