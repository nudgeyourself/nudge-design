# Nudge Icons

#### Adding Icons

Add icon files to the assets folder, update the package version, then run these 3 commands.

```
npm run prebuild
```

```
npm run build
```

Update the package version in package.json and native-icons/package.json

Then run the following command to publish both packages at once.

```
npm run pub
```

After that it's a good idea to update the icons in the docs. In the docs folder run

```
yarn upgrade --latest @nudge-coach/icons
```

then push an update to the main branch. This will kick off the github actions to publish the docs site.
