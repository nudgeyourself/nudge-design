# Basic Style Dictionary

After you make a change to tokens run:

```bash
npm run build
```

If you want to start a watcher run:

```bash
npm run start
```

After updating the tokens you probably want to update the UI library as well. Navigate to /ui, npm run rollup, update the package version, then npm publish.

The docs will automatically update once a push to master has been made.
